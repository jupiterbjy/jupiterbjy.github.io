## Hobbies

This weirdo has a pretty wide range of it:

<!--
Didnt know but if there's no trailing slash in path, relative path use parent dir when requesting resource
-->

- Coding
- 2D Scribbling
- Simple Modeling
- 3D Printing
- SFFPC(Small Form Factor PC) builds
- PC Case modification
- Self hosting home server
- Gaming (Obviously)

And for what I work on, I prefer it to be opened in hope of it being helpful to others - which
can be found on respective links in the contacts section.
